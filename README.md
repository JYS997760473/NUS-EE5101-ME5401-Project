# NUS-EE5101/ME5401-Project

This repository is for EE5101/ME5401 Linear System Project in NUS.

## Abstract

Self-balancing two-wheeled vehicle is quite useful for people who have difficulty in riding a bicycle and it has been developing by applying modern control theory. In this project, we construct a linear state-space system to simulate the true state of this vehicle in real world, and use pole-placement control, LQR control , controller with observer, decoupling control and integral control separately to control and simulate this system using MATLAB and Simulink. Controller and observerâ€™s performance on different inputs and disturbances are also included in this paper and final results prove that these control theories are suitable for this system.

## Requirments

The requirements are all in `project-2022.pdf`.

## Introduction

`ME5401.m` is the main function contain six main requirements in `project-2022.pdf`.

`place_pole.m` contains a pole placement method by using cannocial form.

`my_lqr.m` contains a pole placement method by LQR to find the positive definite solution of the Riccati equation.

`unity_place.m` contains a pole placement method by using Ackermann's formula unity rank method.

`model1-6.slx` are the Simulink models for six different requirements.

## Usage

### With MATLAB Desktop

Type the `run` button to run `ME5401.m` file in MATLAB Destkop.

### Without MATLAB Desktop (In Linux or MacOS terminal)

Run
```bash
./ME5401
```

## Demo and Results

Final results can be found in  `ME5401project.pdf`.
